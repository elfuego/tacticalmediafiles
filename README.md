Tactical Media Files
====================
Sources to build the Tactical Media Files website with MMBase 1.9.

I just presume you will be having the same settings as I have for 
maven and Java. You then should be able to build a runable 
webapplication with the command:

  mvn clean install
  
 All the needed resources are downloaded from several maven servers
 including the mmbase.org server.
