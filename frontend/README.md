Gulp setup for Tactical Media Files
===========

Build html files for new Tactical Media Files site.


This uses a source directory `source` and tests and publishes in a directory `public`. 
I wanted to make it all confirgurable but that was a bit too much of a hassle.

Run the default gulp taks with:

```
$ gulp
```

It will do a first build and start a watch task with BrowserSync on the source directory.
