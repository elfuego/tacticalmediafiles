         What must happen if changes in the cloud are detected. 
         
         Possible values: 
         exception (default): An exception is thrown, warning the user that the data was changed in
                              the mean-time. This can be a useful value if the client handles it
                              gracefully. The editwizards don't.
         warn               : It is warned in the log.
         ignore             : Nothing happens. The commit will simply succeed.
